Exercise 2.7: Data Analysis and Visualization in Django

Learning Goals

●	Work on elements of two-way communication like creating forms and buttons
●	Implement search and visualization (reports/charts) features
●	Use QuerySet API, DataFrames (with pandas), and plotting libraries (with matplotlib)

Reflection Questions

1.	Consider your favorite website/application (you can also take CareerFoundry). Think about the various data that your favorite
 website/application collects. Write down how analyzing the collected data could help the website/application. 
A)	
    Medium
1)	Behavior: Article Views and who user follows
2)	Profile: Data: User preference, history topic selection
3)	Content: Comments, responses and claps

Data collections help personalize the app to the user through history (cookies) and what articles are most often read. This will make the 
user stay on the app longer and possibly engage in Mediums community.

2.	Read the Django official documentation on QuerySet API. Note down the different ways in which you can evaluate a QuerySet.
A)
1) Iteration: executes database QuerySet first time you iterate over it
2) Slicing: QuerySet being sliced using python syntax
3) Pickling/Caching: QuerySet being pickled or cached
4) repr() : Can view results of QuerySet using Api
5) len() : Returns length of results  
6) list() : Forces evaluation of QuerySet
7) bool() : Applies boolean context to QuerySet (True or False)



3.	In the Exercise, you converted your QuerySet to DataFrame. Now do some research on the advantages and disadvantages of QuerySet and 
DataFrame, and explain the ways in which DataFrame is better for data processing.

A)	Data Frames in Python are versatile tools that simplify advanced data analysis and manipulation. They work well will various libraries 
for efficient visualization applications. Their user-friendly structure allows quick inspections and flexible handling of data.
