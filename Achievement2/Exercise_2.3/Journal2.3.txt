Reflection Questions

1.	Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.

A)	Django models define the structure of data for web applications guaranteeing consistency. This leads to a few benefits 
    which include: 

•	DRY once a model is defined the admin site creates an interface.
•	Define data types which leads to consistency in code base.
•	Django abstracts the database to enable easy application to other databases. 
•	With models it creates an easy way to interact with the database creating an enjoyable experience for developers.

2.	In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example 
project to explain your answer.

A)	Testing is crucial throughout a whole project but the most important at the beginning. Testing from the start of a project
 ensures that the foundation of the project works as intended, this will prevent bugs and headaches further down the
  progression of a web application. Testing also ensures that any refactoring or addition of code is not app breaking which
   ensure easy scalability.
