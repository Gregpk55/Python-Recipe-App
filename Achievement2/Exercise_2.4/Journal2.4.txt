Exercise 2.4: Django Views and Templates

Learning Goals

●	Summarize the process of creating views, templates, and URLs 
●	Explain how the “V” and “T” parts of MVT architecture work
●	Create a frontend page for your web application

Reflection Questions

1.	Do some research on Django views. In your own words, use an example to explain how Django views work.

A)	Django view connects the data to the template which is what the user will see. The view gets information from 
the model then passes that information to the template. The template then renders the data in the desired format.

2.	Imagine you’re working on a Django web development project, and you anticipate that you’ll have to reuse lots of code
 in various parts of the project. In this scenario, will you use Django function-based views or class-based views, and why?

A)	If a project required the reuse of a lot of code, I would use class-based views. Class based views (CBVs) implement
 object-oriented programing allowing for variables to be “plugged in”, allowing for code to be applied to many views within a project which implements DRY practices.

3.	 Read Django’s documentation on the Django template language and make some notes on its basics.

A)	The basic parts of Django Template Language:

Templates: 
    contains variables which replace values when the file is executed.

Variables: 
    when the template encounters a variable it replaces it with the results.

Filters: 
    modifies the variable for display (" | ").

Tags: 
    more complex than variables some creating text some control flow of the execution by preforming loops or logic
 along with load external data.

Inheritance: 
    Allows a base template to be created (base.html) with common elements.

Static Files: 
    to include static files like CSS or JS “{% load static %}”

Comments: 
    “{#’ comments ‘# }” comments out and will not be rendered.
