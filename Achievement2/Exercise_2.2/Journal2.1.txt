Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re in an interview. The interviewer gives you their company’s website as an example, asking you to 
convert the website and its different parts into Django terms. How would you proceed? For this question, you can think 
about your dream company and look at their website for reference. 
(Hint: In the Exercise, you saw the example of the CareerFoundry website in the Project and Apps section.)

A)	I would start with looking over the website and acknowledge the functionalities and features, putting them into Django’s 
categories/terms Projects and Apps.

Projects being the complete website application.

Apps being modules with specific functionalities (Store, Products, Login or customer support/help). 



2.	In your own words, describe the steps you would take to deploy a basic Django application locally on your system. 

A)	Step 1: Set up the environment

Step 2: Install Django /double check download

Step 3: Create Django Project 

Step 4: Run migrations

Step 5: Run server

Step 6: Check Access (Localhost)

Step 7: Create a Superuser



3.	Do some research about the Django admin site and write down how you’d use it during your web application development.

A)	The Django Admin site has built in management system tools which allow easy creation of CRUD operations, ability to
 manage user accounts and permissions along with debugging tools. The Django admins site helps developers fast track some of 
 the more tedious parts of web application creation.
