Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

Learning Goals

●	Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

Reflection Questions

1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

A)	Databases are structured collections of data that can be accessed, managed and updated.
This is ideal to any application as it is an efficient way for data to be manipulated, used and easy to scale.


2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:


Data type	  Definition

VARCHAR (n)	- String of variable length, with n representing the maximum number of characters

INT	        - Standard integers

FLOAT	    - Floating-point decimal numbers

3.	 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

A)	SQLite would be a better choice when using lightweight applications for example a webpage for a shop that stores basic
 information. (Prevents having to set up a whole database engine) allowing easily accessible databases.


4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between
 JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

A)	The biggest difference I’ve noticed between Python and JavaScript is the syntax. Python's syntax is much more intuitive 
and simpler. With it being so easy to read and write, I find that I can focus more on materializing my ideas rather than
 rereading every line repeatedly. This gives me a heightened sense of productivity, which in turn motivates me to achieve more.


5.	Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say 
are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

A)	Some disadvantages to python are slow execution not ideal for mobile apps and takes up larger amount of storage 
compared to other languages.
